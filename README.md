# *Prime Objective*

Welcome to my first base project at Prime Digital Academy! My name is Adam Eastvold and this was initally committed on July 26th, 2016. I will be adding to this repository periodically throughout my acedemic journey as needed and assigned. It is my hope that this will turn out something similar to a Tibetan sand mandala. Each time I add, take away, or adjust. It will ultimately lead to something that will be great to reflect upon. 



### **index.html:**

This file, index.html, is where the bones of my webpage are. It is home to my Hypertext Markup Language which will allow any browser to read what I have included, at least from this file. I imagine it will include text, links, forms, lists, tables, and much more. The majority of my general information is here, straight chillin'.

### **styles.css:**

The muscles that hold my bones (HTML) in place are located here in styles.css. Hopefully they will be organized in a certain way that will make it asthetically pleasing and reasonable to understand. My Cascading Style Sheets will be linked to my index.html file which will in turn allow me to select elements, classes, id's, and more. In turn I will be able to manipulate things I choose to act accordingly to what I assign them. In the end this will be a must have on the appearance and layout side of creating my web page.

### **app.js:**

Not only are the brains, but basically the majority of the nervous system can be found here. This is where the logic truly shines. The file, app.js, is what will make this creation come alive in a way using Javascript. Here you will find what gives my web page interactivity, useability, and functionallity. Among these things it will hold all the tools necessary to build whatever is needed, and after you build it you will just find out someone has made a library for it already so you then use that because it is more efficient. Eventually I'll be able to throw some server side stuff in here boosting it's awesomeness. Once JS meets Jquery it then evolves into a power couple; two people who are equally as cool as each other.



## *Disclaimer:*

I really wasn't sure what kind of description was required and everyone will have something very similar if we just copy and paste definitions. So, thanks for reading!
